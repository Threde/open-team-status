# OpenTeamStatus - an opensource StatusHero clone

Veerry much a work in progress. Still need to do most of the auth work.

It's a basic CRUD django app.

```
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 status
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
./manage.py runserver
```
